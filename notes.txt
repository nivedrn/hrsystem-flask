Django vs NodeJS
The security of the Django framework is better than that of Node. js because of the fact that it has a built-in system that protects it from any security failure. Node. js is less secure than the Django framework because it needs a manual operation in the system to administer security flaws.

Projects vs. apps
What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

engine:[//[user[:password]@][host]/[dbname]]
engine -> postgresql
user -> postgres (see `owner` field in previous screenshot)
password -> password (my db password is the string, `password`)
host -> localhost (because we are running locally on out machine)
dbname -> flasksql (this is the name I gave to the db in the previous step)
